# Dependabot configuration for automated version updates
# Documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file
#
# Best Practices:
# - Dependabot always targets the default branch (main)
# - PRs are created for version updates (never pushes directly)
# - Use branch protection rules to prevent direct pushes to main
# - Group updates to reduce PR noise
